    Perform interval intersections such that the end products have identical \
    features for overlapping intervals.

    The VennDiagram package does *set* intersection, not *interval*
    intersection.  So the goal here is to represent intersecting intervals as
    intersecting sets of strings.

    Doing a simple BEDTools intersectBed call doesn't do the trick (even with
    the -u argument).  As a concrete example, what would the string be for an
    intersection of the feature "chr1:1-100" in file `x` and "chr1:50-200" in
    file `y`?

    The method used here is to substitute the intervals in `y` that overlap `x`
    with the corresponding elements in `x`.  This means that in the resulting
    sets, the overlapping features are identical.  To follow up with the
    example, both `x` and `y` would have an item "chr1:50-200" in their sets,
    simply indicating *that* one interval overlapped.

    Venn diagrams are not well suited for nested overlaps or multi-overlaps.
    To illustrate, try drawing the 2-way Venn diagram of the following two
    files. Specifically, what number goes in the middle -- the number of
    features in `x` that intersect `y` (1) or the number of features in `y`
    that intersect `x` (2)?::

        x:
            chr1  1  100
            chr1 500 6000

        y:
            chr1 50 100
            chr1 80 200
            chr9 777 888

    In this case, this function will return the following sets::

        x:
            chr1:1-100
            chr1:500-6000

        y:
            chr1:1-100
            chr9:777-888

    This means that while `x` does not change in length, `y` can.  For example,
    if there are 2 features in `x` that overlap one feature in `y`, then `y`
    will gain those two features in place of its single original feature.

    This strategy is extended for multiple intersections -- see the source for
    details.

    Given a list of interval files, write an R script to create a Venn \

    The R script calls the venn.diagram function of the R package VennDiagram
    for extremely flexible Venn and Euler diagram creation.  Uses
    `cleaned_intersect()` to create string representations of shared intervals.

    `beds` is a list of up to 4 filenames or BedTools.

    `script_filename` is the optional filename to write the R script to
